We then loop over and here I used the \"NIST FIPS\" document linked in the courseroom. Based on some research done online and in combination with the document I have created the next step, first we set it so that word is set to the previous word. We then have if and elif where we check for 1. if the length of the list w (list with all the words) is divisible by NK (the amount of words in the key at first) , if it is we do a left circular shift and then apply the sbox. The first element is then XOR'd by the round constant, which again is for security reasons to protect against slide attacks. 2. else if the length of the list w modulo Nk produces the rest 4 then we only apply the sbox.\n",

In AES this is achieved, if you replace the first number in testBlock from a 0 to 1, it completely changes the ciphertext (output from encrypt function). The main functions contributing to confusion in AES are addRoundKey amd subBytes, the round key uses the expanded key to obscure and subbytes uses an already calculated non-linear box to also achieve confusion."

For example, if the input is all zeros. Then the output should for example be all ones, or if an input like \"01020304\" then an output shouldn't be \"10203040\". Diffusion would aim at destroying these patterns, the functions that are used to provide full diffusion are shiftRows and mixColumns. These 2 work together to switch the places of the values in the input key to make them appear in different places in the output ciphertext."
